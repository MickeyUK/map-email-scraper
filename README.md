## About the Project

This is a standalone application that uses Google Maps and <a href="#features">Hunter.io</a> for collating business contact information.

By default Google search does not show e-mail contact information for establishments, so this tool cross references results with Hunter.io to find any associated public e-mail addresses. 

Map E-Mail Scraper is a useful tool for people generating leads, and is not intended to be used maliciously. Use responsibly folks!

## Features

  * **Create Multiple Query Collections**

  Create multiple search queries and store them in collections for future use.

  * **Export Results**

  Search results can be exported to various formats.
